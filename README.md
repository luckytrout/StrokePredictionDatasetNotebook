# StrokePredictionDatasetNotebook
According to the World Health Organization stroke is the 2nd 
leading cause of death globally, responsible for approximately 11% of total 
deaths. 
This dataset is used to predict whether a patient is likely to get stroke based on 
the input parameters like gender, age, various diseases, and smoking status. 
Each row in the data provides relevant information about the patient. 
# About This Notebook
This notebook will be applying basic data analyzing skills. There are bar plots,
violin plots, a histogram, and a heatmap, which all help visualize the
attributes/features. I use these graphs to explain the data and what it can tell us.
I also apply an imputation method to correct the null values of a feature,
a method to correct the outliers within the data, and label encoding for data types.
